# To-do-List-App


LANGUAGE:  JAVASCRIPT , HTML , CSS
I  have created a fully functional to-do list app  with a beautiful UI implemented by CSS .  
The functions are :
 1 . User can add a to-do by filling the     input and hit ENTER.
2. He can rather check-mark  the to-do when it's done . 
3. He can remove it using the delete button.
4. The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.
5.There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.
6. The to do list app, shows the current date to the user.
